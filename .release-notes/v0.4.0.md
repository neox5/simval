# Release v0.4.0

This release improves seed management for better reproducibility and observability.

## Changes

**Seed Package:**

- Deterministic stream allocation: same master seed now produces identical RNG sequences
- Added `seed.Current()` to expose active seed state for logging and debugging
- Improved reproducibility: `Init(12345)` guarantees consistent source behavior across runs

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/neox5/simv@v0.4.0
```

## Usage Example

```go
import "github.com/neox5/simv/seed"

// Set seed for reproducibility
seed.Init(12345)

// Log current seed state
master, stream, auto := seed.Current()
log.Printf("Seed: master=%d stream=%d auto=%v", master, stream, auto)
```
